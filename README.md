The Ikeda map is a recurrence relation for complex numbers. It is derived from the study of how light moves around a ring laser, which is a component that can measure the Earth's rotation, and potentially can be used to detect gravitational waves.

In the Ikeda map, there is a parameter that when adjusted to specific ranges can create chaotic attractors. This project focusses on visualising the formation of these chaotic attractors and animating them.
